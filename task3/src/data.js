      "The Apple iPhone 7 is the successor to the highly acclaimed iPhone 6s. As such, it brings a multitude of enhancements in key areas, including design, performance, and user experience. While the overall shape and size of the phone have been left intact, there are now glossy and matte black options available. Also, the handset is now IP67-certified, making it water-resistant. On its back, the refined 12MP camera features optical image stabilization, wider aperture of F1.8, and a quad LED TrueTone flash for better low-light performance. Battery life has been given a welcome boost that could provide users around 2 hours of additional use time. The new A10 Fusion chip is up to 40% more powerful than last-year's A9, yet promises great power efficiency. And while the iPhone 7 lacks an audio jack, the box includes Lightning connector EarPods, as well as a Lightning to 3.5mm adapter.",
